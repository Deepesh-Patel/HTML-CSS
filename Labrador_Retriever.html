    <h2>About Labrador retriever</h2>
    <p><em>Labrador retriever</em>, breed of sporting dog that originated in Newfoundland and was brought to England by <strong>fishermen</strong> about 1800. <br>It is an outstanding gun dog, consistently dominating field trials.</br> Standing 21.5 to 24.5 inches (55 to 62 cm) and weighing 55 to 80 pounds (25 to 36 kg), it is more solidly built than other retrievers and has shorter legs. <br>Distinctive features include its otterlike tail, thick at the base and tapered toward the end, and its short, dense coat of black, brown (“chocolate”), or yellow.</br> The Labrador retriever is characteristically rugged, even-tempered, and gentle. <br>In England it has been used in military and police work, as a rescue dog, and as a guide dog for the blind.</br> An ideal family pet, the Labrador retriever became in the 1990s the most popular dog breed in the United States.</p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>Labradors are a medium-large breed, with dogs typically weighing 29–36 kg (65–80 lb) and bitches 25–32 kg (55–70 lb).[5] The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour, are the result of breeding to produce a working retriever.</p>
    <p>As with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically "Show", "English" or "bench") and the Field (typically "Working" or "American") lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries and the origins of both are from British lines. In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose. However, Field Labradors should still be proportional and fit within American Kennel Club standards. </p>
